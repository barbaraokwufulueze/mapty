# mapty

Mapty is a vanilla JavaScript application for tracking workouts. This app was built as a practice project for a JavaScript course taught by Jonas Schmedtmann.

## Usage
As a user, you can log your running and cycling exercises and your workouts are stored in your local storage. The application interacts with the Leaflet library and displays a map.
To add workouts, click on the location of your exercise on the map and record your workout using the form that pops up. Your workout shows on the map along with the workout details. Click on workouts to see the workout details on the map.
